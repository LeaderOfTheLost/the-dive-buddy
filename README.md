## Description:

The Dive Buddy app provides a place for divers to log their dives, add and edit loadouts, and view both.

#### \*built with Mongo, Express, React, and Node.

---

## How to get started

When you open this application you will land on the homepage. From there you can navigate to a diver of your choice to view their dive logs and loadouts. In dive logs you will be able to create a new log or get rid of a log that you don't want. If you are in the loadouts section you will be able to build a loadout and use it as a checklist for a dive trip.

- `Fork` and `Clone`
- `cd` into the new directory
- `npm install` to install dependencies
- run `npm run dev` in main directory
- run `npm start` in client directory
